# SellHub Discord Bot

## Overview
The SellHub Discord Bot is a production-ready, highly stable Discord bot with **AI-powered analytics and predictive intelligence**. It manages product stock, automates item replacement, synchronizes product variants with SellHub, and provides comprehensive automation with intelligent monitoring, professional staff notifications, and advanced moderation. It combines traditional commerce operations with cutting-edge AI for trend analysis, sales predictions, and smart alerts.

## User Preferences
I prefer clear, concise, and structured explanations. Focus on high-level decisions and their impact. For coding, prioritize robust error handling, security, and maintainability. When making changes, ensure comprehensive logging is in place and that the system remains stable and performant. I prefer to be informed about critical bug fixes and architectural changes.
